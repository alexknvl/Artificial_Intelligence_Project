Initial notes for the project proposal

Two ideas so far:

1. Natural Language Slang Discovery 
    - Pulls data from Twitter
    - Takes the data and looks for particular words and trys to find their slang alterations

2. Computer Vision Object Analysis
    - Takes from an image data set
      - Processes it in a training phase to learn different kinds of objects
    - Then name objects in real-time environments from a computer connected camera or smart-phone
      -Alternate option would be taking a data set of environments with the objects in the environment and seeing how well the A.I. performs at the identification of different objects in the picture
      -Another option could be naming things it recognizes in the image from its training phases

Chapters 22 and 24 in the book describe Natural Language processing and Computer vision, respectively  

3. Music Sound Sampling
    - Decompile the song so that it can be modififed
    - Looking at different artists and their samples to see how they compare

4. Gathering wifi signal data to share position with friends
    - see where you are in respect all those points
    - A service that tells you where your friends are based on wifi data
    - uses a neural network to find the position of a person from wifi data
    - Goal: 3D map of your position or router positions
    - optimal signal locations
    
5 Genomic Sequence analysis with machine learning

6. Game simulation with multiple agents
