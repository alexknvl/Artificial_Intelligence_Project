Initial notes for the project proposal

Two ideas so far:

1. Natural Language Slang Discovery 
    - Pulls data from Twitter
    - Takes the data and looks for particular words and trys to find their slang alterations

2. Computer Vision Object Analysis
    - Takes from an image data set
      - Processes it in a training phase to learn different kinds of objects
    - Then name objects in real-time environments from a computer connected camera or smart-phone
      -Alternate option would be taking a data set of environments with the objects in the environment and seeing how well the A.I. performs at the identification of different objects in the picture
      -Another option could be naming things it recognizes in the image from its training phases

Chapters 22 and 24 in the book describe Natural Language processing and Computer vision, respectively
